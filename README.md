# Real-Time Traffic Light Control System with Pedestrian Crossing

## Description
The Real-Time Traffic Light Control System with Pedestrian Crossing is a project that simulates the operation of a traffic light system for a main road and crossroad. It includes an integrated pedestrian crossing system, controlled by a slide switch, which activates pedestrian lights and a boom barrier. The system is managed by an Arduino microcontroller, using traffic light LEDs to display the status of each road, an I2C LCD display to show the system status, and a Servo motor to open or close the boom barrier. Additionally, a buzzer is used to alert when pedestrian crossing is active. This project demonstrates the application of state-based control logic to manage traffic and pedestrian signals for enhanced safety and efficiency.

## Features:
- **Main Road Traffic Lights**: Controls the green, yellow, and red signals for the main road traffic.
- **Crossroad Traffic Lights**: Alternates between green, yellow, and red signals for the crossroad.
- **Pedestrian Crossing**: Activated via a slide switch to allow safe pedestrian movement across the road.
- **Boom Barrier**: The boom barrier automatically opens when the pedestrian light is green and closes after the pedestrian crossing is finished.
- **LCD Display**: Displays the system's status, including the active signal and a timer.
- **Buzzer**: Sounds when the pedestrian crossing is active for alerting nearby vehicles.

## Technologies Used:
- **Arduino Uno**
- **I2C LCD (16x2)**
- **Servo Motor**
- **LEDs**
- **Buzzer**
- **C Programming**
